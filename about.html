        <h3>Why "Rooted Generation"</h3>
        <p>Mental health is incredibly important not only to the individual, but also to society at large. If large swaths of a population no longer see the point in getting out of bed how can we expect them to go out and actually maintain a civilization? As of Jan. 2023, 35.8% of Millennials and 44.5% of Gen Z suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is suffered at 27.9% and 30.9% respectivly as well. We've all heard the jokes about the younger generations, but this really is no laughing matter. We need to get to the bottom of what is causing these issues and how we can solve them.</p>
